## Running the Project (Local)

### Prerequisites

- **Go** ‚â• 1.22 (install the latest stable)

- **Node.js** ‚â• 18 and **npm**

- A **MongoDB** connection string (Atlas or local)

> The app seeds the **Departments** collection on first run, so you don‚Äôt need a manual seed step.

### 1) First-time setup

**1.1 Clone the repo**

    git clone https://github.com/<your-user>/<your-repo>.git
    cd <your-repo>

**1.2 Create env files**

Backend (backend/.env)

    PORT=5000
    MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>
    JWT_SECRET=<a-long-random-secret>
    # Optional in local (CORS already allows localhost:5173)
    # CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173


Frontend (frontend/.env)

    VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api


**1.3 Install dependencies**

Backend

    cd backend
    go mod download  

Frontend

    cd frontend
    npm install


### 2) Run (first time & every time)

You‚Äôll run two terminals:one for backend, one for frontend.

Terminal A ‚Äì Backend

    cd backend
    go run main.go
    # API up at http://localhost:5000

Terminal B ‚Äì Frontend

    cd frontend
    npm run dev
    # App up at http://localhost:5173

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser and log in.


### 3) Subsequent runs (after the first day)


You don‚Äôt need to reinstall anything unless dependencies changed.

Backend

    cd backend
    go run main.go

Frontend

    cd frontend
    npm run dev


### Notes & Tips

- **CORS (local)**: Already whitelisted for `http://localhost:5173` and `http://127.0.0.1:5173`. `CLIENT_URL` is **not required** locally.

- **CORS (prod)**: When deployed, set `CLIENT_URL` on the backend to your Vercel URL, and set `VITE_API_URL` on the frontend to your backend‚Äôs `/api` base.

- **Ports**: Backend defaults to `:5000`; Frontend (Vite) defaults to `:5173`.

- **Mongo**: Use Atlas or a local MongoDB; just point `MONGO_URI` to the right place.

- **Auto seed**: `Departments` indexes + seed run automatically on backend start if empty.
